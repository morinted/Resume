## Experience

### Open Source Developer

- Current lead developer for Plover, [open source stenography software](http://opensteno.org) written in Python.
- Original projects include:
    * a schedule generator for the University of Ottawa. This Java project used
      a UML code generator for its core data structures, has a Swing/AWT GUI,
      draws on a Canvas, and uses a client/server architecture. The web scraping
      component is made up of two Python scripts. One is a selenium web-driver
      job that explores the uOttawa website to grab all the course names, and
      the second is a multi-threaded script to grab the course
      details, and parses the data with Beautiful Soup and RegEx.
    * Bozzy, a stenographic dictionary reader written in Scala, as a fourth
      year capstone project.

#### GCMS Automated Tester

*May 2013 to August 2013*

- Redesigned the test-running Java GUI to be more concise by reducing clutter
  and predicting user action.

  team had been assigned.
